        <p className='text-brand font-mon text-xl text-justify md:text-start md:text-3xl md:w-2/3 my-5'>This website is inspired by a thought-provoking video exploring the battle between the Goddess of Everything Else and the Goddess of Cancer. We delve into the intriguing concept of these contrasting forces shaping the universe: order versus chaos, randomness versus structure, the unexpected beauty that arises from the unpredictable.</p>
        {/* <p className='text-brand font-bold font-mon text-2xl w-1/2 my-5'>Our goal is to create a vibrant space to explore these themes. We encourage you to dive into the video, learn about the goddesses, and consider their influence on life's evolution, from the single-celled beginnings to the vastness of space exploration.  Join the discussion, share your interpretations, and maybe even create some memes â€“ all in the spirit of celebrating the unexpected!</p> */}
